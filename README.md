## Description
Our app is a user-friendly platform designed to simplify the process of organizing and managing events. This app allows event organizers and users to easily create and publish events, manage attendee information, and track event performance. With the ability to upload event details, photos, and ticket information, this app helps event organizers promote their events and reach a wider audience. One of the key benefits of using our app is the ability to easily share event information across multiple platforms. Additionally, event organizers can use the app to collect feedback from attendees and track event performance metrics such as ticket sales, revenue, and attendance. Also rating system for events and users can show  the reliability of the user. If the event has more than 100 attendees its event manager needs to be verified by the admins before he could have upload to the system. Our application also provides multiple filtering at the same time with variety of options in each.
